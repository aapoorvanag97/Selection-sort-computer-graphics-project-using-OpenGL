ALGORITHM:

Selection-Sort (A)

For i ← 1 to n-1 do

min j ← i;

min x ← A[i]

for j ←i + 1 to n do

if A[j] &lt; min x then

min j ← j

min x ← A[j]

A[min j] ← A [i]

A[i] ← min x

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place
comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the
left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the
unsorted part is the entire list.
The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost
element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving
unsorted array boundary by one element to the right. Applications of Selection sorting
algorithm include organizing items by price on a retail website and determining the order of
sites on a search engine results page.
